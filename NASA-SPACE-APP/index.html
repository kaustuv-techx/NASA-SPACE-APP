                        A new respiratory virus called the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19 is making headlines for causing an outbreak of respiratory illness throughout the world. The outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and quickly spread internationally – including to the United States. Thousands of people have become sick and public health officials are keeping a close watch on how the virus is spreading.

                        Ever since the Big Bang event that started it all, the universe had been drifting and
                        expanding, stars were dying, while some were just born, leaving galaxies behind
                        that also included our solar system. The cause of this big event was a companion
                        of two black holes collapsing into each other drifting gases and molecules,
                        elements everywhere in the surrounding

                        the sun had swapped in small volumes of hydrogen and helium ,while the big
                        heavy elements formed planets with the help of gravity creating a big dusty rocky
                        mass that kept orbiting the sun for 4.5 billion years. It all started with a mixture of
                        mysterious ingredients, ingredients that are simply the main reason for a life
                        thrive. Energy, organic molecules, liquids (water), life exists wherever those
                        belongs.

                        No organism could survive there, radiation from the recent supernova kept the
                        planet extremely hot, the surface was weak as the Oxygen was still nonexistent.
                        Rocks, meteorites and huge massive asteroids had frequently slammed on the
                        surface. By the time earth was pretty close to the sun, it got so hot that it started
                        melting, heavier materials sank to the bottom while lighter ones rose to the top,
                        some elements evaporated and some stayed at their position, this transformation
                        created the earth’s layered core. mantle, crust, atmosphere and magnetic field,
                        without these earth would just have had been blasted by harmful rays from the

                        Researchers and scientists had suggested that life emerged over 3 or 4 billion
                        years ago, When earth was empty, more likely lifeless. Temperatures were
                        extremely hot with frequent volcanic activity and hellish environmental activities.
                        the atmosphere was just a cloud of interstellar gas and dust which were defined
                        as nebula, moon was just getting formed due to a prototype planets collision into
                        earth. In other words, we believe that those collisions could have sparked the
                        chemical building blocks for life, the “DNA” double helix.

                        Eventually , super heated gases were able to escape into outer space, but as the
                        climate on earth became more stable instead of molten, they where held by
                        gravity to form the early atmosphere.

                    <p>
                        The earth started to cool down below 212 degrees Fahrenheit. At this time about
                        3.8 billion years ago, the water considered into rain which filled the basins that
                        are now “oceans”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        About almost 250 million years ago, after the earth cooled down enough, all the
                        continents of the time had joined together to form a super-continent called
                        Pangaea. by the time of unstoppable continues tectonic activity, position of
                        Pangaea was changed, and it began to break apart about 175 million years ago
                        into two new continents Laurasia and Gondwanaland. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Between 3.2 and 2.4 billion years ago, photosynthetic organisms appeared, and
                        began to enriching the atmosphere with oxygen, from here starts life’s voyage.
                        Single-celled organisms consumed the sun’s energy. as a waste product, the
                        Cyanobacteria eventually filled the oceans and lands with oxygen. Earth now had
                        an oxygenated atmosphere for new life to flourish, but it was different for the
                        Cyanobacteria, oxygen was toxic to them! But as the time had flew, resistant
                        forms survived and thrived, while some developed the ability to use oxygen to
                        increase their metabolism and obtain more energy from the same food. At this
                        time methane was more abundant in the atmosphere, his role was trapping heat
                        in the atmosphere, it’s one of the efficient greenhouse gases, When oxygen
                        combined with methane it produced carbon dioxide. However the greenhouse
                        effect was not so strong, as a result the whole planet froze. As the ice spread,
                        more heat was reflected back into space rather than absorbed by the planet,
                        dropping temperatures down in a runaway effect sped the formation of ice. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The world remained almost completely frozen for around 10 million years before
                        warming again. Therefore, the oxygen completely filled the atmosphere, and the
                        earth’s ozone layer thickened. before the presence of the ozone layer, life was
                        restricted to shallow water, Because water shielded and blocked harmful
                        radiation from the sun, that’s where life began to exist. Eventually, a thicker
                        ozone layer enabled life to diversify on land. It took another 3 billion years for life
                        to evolve the complexity of plants and animals that you could see with your naked
                        eye. 541 million years ago, hard-shelled invertebrates originated in the oceans
                        and life got more diverse from there.

                        Next came the age of fish, when thousands of fish species arose, plants and fungi
                        where the first to venture out of the water in a dry habitat, requiring them to
                        adapt to new conditions on dry terrain.

                    <p>
                        Some fish in close proximity to land and gradually adapted to life there,
                        simultaneously developing lungs. Amphibious were the first vertebrates to make
                        the move to land and the transition to life on land benefitted these creatures
                        because there was no predators to begin with and food was plentiful, that was
                        just the start of the age of amphibians.

                    <p>
                        Eventually when the earth became hotter and drier, rainforests collapsed
                        triggering the age of reptiles^ depicted by Tyrannosaurus rex locked in eternal
                        conflict with mortal enemy Triceratops. because reptiles evolved to dry land
                        conditions, they gained a unique ecological advantage. At this time we all knew
                        Pangaea existed as one super-continent in this area where they used to live on,
                        but because of the tectonic movements it tore apart the plate as we mentioned
                        before. We wont forget that dinosaurs existed for 160 million years, so
                        continental drift gradually drifted dinosaurs apart.

                        Sometime on December 26th (in the cosmic calendar), about 200 million years
                        ago the first mammals evolved, they brought a new feature to life on earth, the
                        “neocortex”. Back in the Triassic the odds where against her kind, they were
                        probably nocturnal to escape predation but the Dinosaurs that terrorized the
                        mammals went extinct and it was the evolution of neocortex and small furtive
                        creatures that enabled their descendants to take over the planet.In the Stone
                        Age, humans struggled to survive , or maybe the earth has.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5 billion years to build the earth, and only several years to ruin it.
                        Intelligence can be a very selective advantage, the fate of this planet was changed
                        forever by an event involving just 13 atoms. A mutation occurred in the DNA of
                        just one of our ancestors, every source of self-esteem, everything we’ve learned
                        and built might come down to nothing more than the one Bay span of a single
                        gene, just a single rung that program the neocortex to grow larger still and fold
                        more deeply, which is more like growth of the first ever mammals. Whatever it
                        was it led to a change in our species and in our way of living, that will ultimately
                        affect every other species of life on earth.

                    Earth Science is the study of the Earth and its neighbors in space. It is an exciting science with many interesting and practical applications. Some Earth scientists use their knowledge of the Earth to locate and develop energy and mineral resources. Others study the impact of human activity on Earth's environment, and design methods to protect the planet. Some use their knowledge about Earth processes such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes to plan communities that will not expose people to these dangerous events.

                    Many different sciences are used to learn about the Earth; however, the four basic areas of Earth science study are: geology, meteorology, oceanography, and astronomy. A brief explanation of these sciences is provided below.

                    Geology is the primary Earth science. The word means "study of the Earth." Geology deals with the composition of Earth materials, Earth structures, and Earth processes. It is also concerned with the organisms of the planet and how the planet has changed over time. Geologists search for fuels and minerals, study natural hazards, and work to protect Earth's environment.

                 <li> <b>METEOROLOGY: Science of the Atmosphere - </b>
                Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere and how processes in the atmosphere determine Earth's weather and climate. Meteorology is a very practical science because everyone is concerned about the weather. How climate changes over time in response to the actions of people is a topic of urgent worldwide concern. The study of meteorology is of critical importance in protecting Earth's environment.

                <li><b> OCEANOGRAPHY: Science of the Oceans - </b> 
                Oceanography is the study of Earth's oceans - their composition, movement, organisms and processes. The oceans cover most of our planet and are important resources for food and other commodities. They are increasingly being used as an energy source. The oceans also have a major influence on the weather, and changes in the oceans can drive or moderate climate change. Oceanographers work to develop the ocean as a resource and protect it from human impact. The goal is to utilize the oceans while minimizing the effects of our actions.

                <li><b> ASTRONOMY: Science of the Universe - </b>  
                Astronomy is the study of the universe. Here are some examples of why studying space beyond Earth is important: the moon drives the ocean's tidal system, asteroid impacts have repeatedly devastated Earth's inhabitants, and energy from the sun drives our weather and climates. A knowledge of astronomy is essential to understanding the Earth. Astronomers can also use a knowledge of Earth materials, processes and history to understand other planets - even those outside of our own solar system.

                    THE IMPORTANCE OF ERATH SCIENCE:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Today we live in a time when the Earth and its inhabitants face many challenges. Our climate is changing, and that change is being caused by human activity. Earth scientists recognized this problem and will play a key role in efforts to resolve it. We are also challenged to: develop new sources of energy that will have minimal impact on climate; locate new sources of metals and other mineral resources as known sources are depleted; and, determine how Earth's increasing population can live and avoid serious threats such as volcanic activity, earthquakes, landslides, floods and more. These are just a few of the problems where solutions depend upon a deep understanding of Earth science

                    NASA's EARTH SCIENCE :
                </h3>
                <img src="./images/earth science image 2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    NASA’s Earth Science Division (ESD) missions help us to understand our planet’s interconnected systems, from a global scale down to minute processes. Working in concert with a satellite network of international partners, ESD can measure precipitation around the world, and it can employ its own constellation of small satellites to look into the eye of a hurricane. ESD technology can track dust storms across continents and mosquito habitats across cities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ESD delivers the technology, expertise and global observations that help us to map the myriad connections between our planet’s vital processes and the effects of ongoing natural and human-caused changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using observations from satellites, instruments on the International Space Station, airplanes, balloons, ships and on land, ESD researchers collect data about the science of our planet’s atmospheric motion and composition; land cover, land use and vegetation; ocean currents, temperatures and upper-ocean life; and ice on land and sea. These data sets, which cover even the most remote areas of Earth, are freely and openly available to anyone.
                </p>

                    NASA Earth Fleet
                </p>
                <p>
                    The four program elements of ESD design the science and technology, launch airborne and space missions, analyze the data and observations, and develop ways to put the information to use for societal benefit. ESD also sponsors research and extends science and technology education to learners of all ages, inspiring the next generation of explorers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than collecting the data, however, ESD works with government and commercial partners in the U.S. and internationally to put that unique information to work as we explore our home planet, improve lives and safeguard the future for people all over the world. Earth science research also helps advance space exploration by helping scientists recognize the basic markers for life across the universe.

                    We all have the same questions in mind, what does the future look like? How will
                    the universe meet it’s end? We may never be truly certain.
                    But science has begun to paint a stunning picture of how the future might unfold.
                    The vision of the future will surly evolve as we probe for more clues. But one
                    thing is sure and clear: the universe has only just begun.

                    Scientists have just assigned three new ages to the Holocene which is the current
                    epoch in which we live. But by 2023, the Holocene will end. What we do now and
                    in the next few years, will profoundly effect the next few thousand years. The
                    only conditions humans have ever known so far, are changing fast, Because
                    nothing remains the same, not even on this planet. The earth is going into one of
                    these jumps and you don’t know what is gonna be on the other side of those
                    jumps, the earth was always jumping. Everything moves on this planet, things are
                    not still, everything is turning.
