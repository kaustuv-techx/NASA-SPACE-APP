                        Aerosols refer to fine solid or liquid particles
                        suspended in the atmosphere, where they reside typically
                        for days to weeks before falling to the ground or being
                        washed out by rain or snow. They arise both from human
                        activities involving burning of fossil fuels, biofuels
                        and veg and from natural sources (such as desert dust,
                        sea spray and volcanic eruptions). Aerosol particles are
                        tiny, but numerous, and often comprise of a number of
                        inorganic and organic substances. Visible forms of
                        atmospheric aerosol plumes include smoke, smog, haze and
                        dust.

                    <br />
                    <h2>How do aerosols affect climate?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Aerosols can influence the Earth’s climate in two ways.
                        When the sky is clear (devoid of clouds), aerosols can
                        reflect incoming sunlight back to outer space – the
                        direct effect. This blocks part of the energy that would
                        have reached the surface, thus having a cool effect on
                        the climate. Absorbing aerosols, black carbon in
                        particular, can trap solar energy within the atmosphere.
                        Although absorption, like reflection, tends to reduce
                        sunlight at the ground level, the enhanced atmospheric
                        heating eventually warms up the surface, and counteracts
                        the cooling caused by reflection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As illustrated vividly by “ship tracks”, cloud
                        reflectance or albedo goes up with the number of aerosol
                        particles that provide nucleating sites for forming
                        cloud droplets. The resulting brightening of clouds
                        renders them more potent at shielding the surface from
                        sunlight, causing the first indirect effect (or cloud
                        albedo effect). More aerosols may also enable clouds to
                        last longer by suppressing rainfall – the second
                        indirect effect (or cloud lifetime effect).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite many years of active research, aerosols are
                        still the least certain of all known climate forcings.
                        This seriously hinders our ability to separate the roles
                        of aerosols and greenhouse gases in driving the past
                        climate change, thereby precluding one from reliably
                        projecting the future climate.

                    <p>
                        Scientists at GFDL tackle the problem, by creatively
                        bridging the several-orders-of-magnitude gaps in
                        temporal and spatial scales between aerosol/cloud
                        microphysics and climate models, We design and implement
                        first principles-based parameterizations of the
                        microphysical processes central to simulating the
                        aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions (e.g., cloud
                        droplet activation and meteorological evolution,
                        internal mixing of absorbing and non-absorbing aerosol
                        species, and hygroscopic growth of water-soluble
                        aerosols) in order to improve their model
                        representation. The enhanced model physics allows one to
                        simulate the climate impacts of aerosols and clouds with
                        unprecedented realism.

                    <p>
                        This year has seen unprecedented wildfires cause havoc
                        across the world. Australia recently battled its largest
                        bushfire on record, while parts of the Arctic,
                        the Amazon and central Asia have also experienced
                        unusually severe blazes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It follows on from “the year rainforests burned” in
                        2019. Last year saw the Amazon face its third-largest
                        fire on record, while intense blazes also raged
                        in Indonesia, North America and Siberia, among other
                        regions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A rapid analysis released this year found that climate
                        change made the conditions for Australia’s unprecedented
                        2019-20 bushfires at least 30% more likely.
                        Further analysis – visualised below in an interactive
                        map – has shown that, globally, climate change is
                        driving an increase in the weather conditions that can
                        stoke wildfires.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But despite a growing field of evidence suggesting that
                        climate change is making the conditions for fire more
                        likely, research finds that the total area burned by
                        wildfires each year decreased by up to a quarter in the
                        past two decades.

                        Understanding this paradox requires scientists to assess
                        a vast range of influential factors, including climate
                        change, human land-use and political and social
                        motivations.

                        In this explainer, Carbon Brief examines how wildfires
                        around the world are changing, the influence of global
                        warming and how risks might multiply in the future.

                    <h2>When and where are most of the world’s wildfires?</h2>
                    <p>
                        At any given time, some part of the world is on fire.
                        The map below, from the Global Forest Watch, shows where
                        in the world has had a fire in the past 24 hours.

                    <p>
                        A <u>“wildfire”</u> can be defined as any type of
                        uncontrolled fire that is spreading across wildland,
                        including pastureland, forests, grasslands and
                        peatlands. (Sometimes, fires are started intentionally
                        and in a controlled manner, including during “<u
                            >prescribed burning</u
                        >”.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Globally, wildfires have many impacts on humans,
                        wildlife and the economy. Wildfires are a major
                        driver of greenhouse gas emissions and are also
                        responsible for 5-8% of the 3.3 million annual premature
                        deaths from poor air quality, research suggests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some wildfires are started naturally, chiefly by
                        lightning. The rest are started by humans, either
                        accidentally or by arson.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Across the world, it is estimated that just 4% of fires
                        start naturally. However, the proportion of
                        human-started versus lightning-started fires varies
                        widely from region to region. For example, in the
                        US, 84% of fires are started by humans. However, in
                        Canada, the majority (55%) of wildfires are started by
                        lightning.

                    <p>
                        Many regions experience distinct wildfire seasons,
                        driven by rainy and dry periods and human practices,
                        such as agricultural burning. However, other regions
                        have a risk of fire year-round.

                        North America, the Amazon, southern Africa and parts of
                        Australia tend to see an uptick in fires from around
                        August to late November. These months coincide with the
                        height of the dry season in southern Africa and the
                        Amazon.

                        By contrast, central Africa and parts of southeast Asia
                        see most of their fires in December through to March.
                        This coincides with the peak of the dry season in
                        Africa’s Sahel region, which is north of the equator.

                        The year 2019 saw several large and – in some cases –
                        unprecedented wildfires.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The UK had a record-breaking year in terms of total area
                        burned by fire, with most its fires occurring in
                        February to April. In June to July, more than 100
                        intense fires broke out across the Arctic Circle, mostly
                        in Alaska and Siberia. August saw the Amazon battle its
                        third-largest fires on record, while September saw large
                        fires in North America and Indonesia. Towards the end of
                        the year, Australia began to face its largest bushfires
                        on record.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Australia’s unprecedented fire season continued into
                        2020, coming to a close at the end of March. The spring
                        saw the return of fires to rural parts of the UK –
                        likely boosted by an unusually hot winter, which left
                        vegetation dry. The end of March also saw large fires
                        break out in southwestern China, which killed at
                        least 19 people and forced almost 25,000 more to
                        evacuate.

                    <p>
                        From March to July this year, unprecedented heat in the
                        Arctic fanned large “zombie fires” in Siberia. The fires
                        ripped across vast stretches of permafrost, threatening
                        the release of millions of tonnes of long-held carbon.

                        Fires in the Amazon remained unusually severe in July
                        and hit a new high in August. In
                        September, Unearthed reported that fires in Brazil’s
                        Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, had reached their
                        highest level since records began in 1998.

                        At the same time, the western US entered into a
                        record-breaking fire season. Since September, fires
                        in California have been at their highest level on record
                        – and the entire west coast is currently on track to see
                        more land burned by fire in 2020 than in any other year
                        since modern records began in the 1980s.

                        across the west coast from 2000 to 2020. On the map, new

                        The US fires have killed at least 30 people and left
                        millions suffering from unsafe air pollution from smoke
                        across the west coast. The fires have also wiped out
                        populations of endangered species, including half of
                        Washington’s pygmy rabbit population, according to
                        the New York Times.

                        Though fires happen all over the world, the largest and
                        fastest-spreading fires mostly occur in sparsely
                        populated grasslands in Australia, Africa and central
                        Asia, according to NASA’s fire datasets.

                    <h2>How is climate change affecting wildfire risk?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are several ways in which climate change can raise
                        the risk of wildfires – and the importance of each of
                        these factors varies from region to region, says Dr
                        Cristina Santin, a wildfires researcher from Swansea
                        University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, in general, one of the most important ways that
                        climate change can increase the risk of severe fires is
                        by causing vegetation to dry out, she says.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When temperatures are warmer than average, rates of
                        evaporation increase, causing moisture to be drawn out
                        from plants on the land. This drying can create
                        “tinderbox conditions” – meaning that, if a fire is
                        sparked, it can spread very quickly over large areas. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Research led by Kirchmeier-Young found that Canada’s
                        2017 fire season, which saw a record 1.2m hectares of
                        land burned, was driven by “extreme warm and dry
                        conditions” heightened by climate change. The study
                        estimated that the total area burned across the season
                        was made seven to 11 times larger by climate change.

                    <p>
                        Further south, in California, a research paper published
                        in 2020 found that the number of autumn days with
                        weather suitable for wildfires has doubled since the
                        1980s as a result of climate change.

                        This year, Science Brief – a UK-based web platform run
                        by a team of scientists – released a review of 73
                        scientific studies finding that climate change is
                        increasing the risk of wildfires at a global level. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the review, the scientists analysed all research
                        papers published since 2013 that investigate the link
                        between climate change and wildfires, either in a
                        certain region or from a global perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The researchers assessed how each study compared to the
                        statement: “Climate change increases the risk of
                        wildfires”.

                    <h2>Are wildfires increasing across the globe?</h2>
                    <p>
                        With climate change raising the risk of hot and dry
                        weather in many parts of the world, it may seem prudent
                        to assume that the global area burned by wildfires each
                        year is increasing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, several research papers looking into wildfires
                        at a global level have come to the opposite conclusion.
                        A paper published in the journal Science found that,
                        globally, the area burned by wildfires decreased by 25%
                        between 2003 and 2015.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are several reasons why global burnt area could be
                        decreasing at a global level despite the effect of
                        warming, explains Santin, who co-authored a research
                        paper looking into this paradox in 2016. In northern
                        Australia, firefighters use “prescribed burning” – a
                        technique pioneered by indigenous communities involving
                        the burning of small patches of grassland early on in
                        the dry season. This creates “fire breaks” in the
                        landscape, which can prevent fires from quickly
                        spreading over large areas of wildland.

                        Climate change will continue to drive temperature
                        rise and more unpredictable rainfall in many parts of
                        the world, meaning that the number of days with “fire
                        weather” – conditions in which fires are likely to burn
                        – is expected to increase in coming decades, says
                        Kirchmeier-Young:

                        A study covered by Carbon Brief found that, by the
                        middle of the century, there could be a 35% increase in
                        the days with a high danger of fire across the world, on
                        average – if little action is taken to tackle climate

                        scenario (“RCP8.5”) include the western US, southeastern

                        For example, a study published in 2020 found that, in
                        California, “climate change will further amplify the
                        number of days with extreme fire weather by the end of
                        this century”. However if efforts are taken to limit
                        global warming to below 2C, which is the goal of
                        the Paris Agreement, this “would substantially curb that
                        increase”, the authors say.

                        which is the aspirational target of the Paris Agreement,
                        could halve the total area burned by wildfires in the
                        summer, when compared to a scenario where warming
                        reaches 3C, according to a second study.

                        In Australia, days with fire weather akin to that seen
                        during the 2019-2020 bushfires could become at least
                        four times more likely under 2C of global warming,
                        according to Otto’s recent analysis.

                        (IPCC) concluded (pdf) that limiting global warming to
                        1.5C rather 2C would “reduce” the average wildfire risk

                        Indeed, a research paper published in 2016 found that,
                        globally, human efforts could suppress wildfire
                        increases in the near future, but that these efforts may

                        Have you ever suffered from sunburn? This burning of the
                        skin is caused by ultraviolet (UV) light from the Sun.
                        Serious burning is not only painful, but it may cause
                        skin cancer.

                    <p>
                        Fortunately, almost all of the harmful UV radiation is
                        absorbed by a layer of ozone gas 20 – 50 km above the
                        Earth. However, ozone is a form of oxygen that can be
                        destroyed easily by certain man-made chemicals.

                        In 1987, the leading industrial countries agreed to
                        phase out these chemicals. Even so, satellites have
                        shown that thinning of the ozone layer has continued
                        over Antarctica. The ozone hole reached a record size in
                        2000, when it covered nearly 30 million sq. km, roughly
                        the size of the North American continent. In 2006, an
                        even greater amount of ozone was lost from the
                        atmosphere, even though the hole was slightly smaller.

                        Smaller ozone holes have also appeared over the Arctic.
                        These holes allow more UV light to reach densely
                        populated areas of Europe.

                        ESA satellites such as MetOp and Envisat play a key role
                        in ozone hole studies. They enable scientists to monitor
                        the size of the hole and learn more about what causes it

                        NASA conducts a program of breakthrough research on
                        climate science, enhancing the ability of the
                        international scientific community to advance global

                    <p>
                        The agency's research encompasses solar activity, sea
                        level rise, the temperature of the atmosphere and the
                        oceans, the state of the ozone layer, air pollution, and
                        changes in sea ice and land ice. NASA scientists
                        regularly appear in the mainstream press as climate
                        experts. So how did the space agency end up taking such
                        a big role in climate science?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When NASA was first created by the National Aeronautics
                        and Space Act of 1958, it was given the role of
                        developing technology for “space observations,” but it
                        wasn’t given a role in Earth science. The agency’s
                        leaders embedded the technology effort in an Earth
                        Observations program centered at the new Goddard Space
                        Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, in the U.S.. It
                        was an “Applications” program, in NASA-speak. Other
                        agencies of the federal government were responsible for
                        carrying out Earth science research: the Weather Bureau
                        (now the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
                        or NOAA) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The
                        Applications program signed cooperative agreements with
                        these other agencies that obligated NASA to develop
                        observational technology while NOAA and the USGS carried
                        out the scientific research. The Nimbus series of
                        experimental weather satellites and the Landsat series
                        of land resources satellites were the result of the
                        Applications program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Applications model of cross-agency research failed
                        during the 1970s, though, due to the bad economy and an
                        extended period of high inflation. Congress responded by
                        cutting the budgets of all three agencies, leaving NOAA
                        and the USGS unable to fund their part of the
                        arrangement and putting pressure on NASA, too. At the
                        same time, congressional leaders wanted to see NASA
                        doing more research toward “national needs.” These needs
                        included things like energy efficiency, pollution, ozone
                        depletion and climate change. In 1976, Congress revised
                        the Space Act to give NASA authority to carry out
                        stratospheric ozone research, formalizing the agency’s
                        movement into the Earth sciences.

                    <p>
                        NASA’s planetary program had a lot to do with scientific
                        and congressional interest in expanding the agency’s
                        role in Earth science. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
                        NASA's lead center for planetary science, sent Mariner
                        series probes to Venus and Mars. Astronomers considered
                        these to be the "Earth-like" planets in the solar
                        system, most likely to have surface conditions able to
                        support life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But that's not what they found. Venus had been roasted
                        by a super-charged greenhouse effect. In contrast to
                        Earth, Venus had about 300 times more carbon dioxide in
                        its atmosphere, no significant water vapor and a surface
                        temperature hotter than molten lead. Mars, on the other
                        hand, had an atmospheric pressure about 1 percent of
                        that of planet Earth and temperatures far below
                        freezing. Pictures showed no surface water - it would
                        have been frozen anyway - but they also seemed to show
                        that it once had liquid water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These discoveries left planetary scientists with
                        unanswered questions. How did Earth, Venus and Mars wind
                        up so radically different from similar origins? How
                        could Mars have once been warm enough to be wet, but be
                        frozen solid now? These questions revolve around climate
                        and the intersection of climate, atmospheric chemistry
                        and, on Earth, life.

                        satellites as well as from certain European, Japanese
                        and Russian satellites. NASA also sponsors field
                        experiments to provide "ground truth" data to check
                        space instrument performance and to develop new
                        measurement techniques.

                        Instruments on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites have
                        provided the first global measurements of aerosols in
                        our atmosphere, which come from natural sources such as
                        volcanoes, dust storms and man-made sources such as the
                        burning of fossil fuels. Other instruments onboard the
                        Aura satellite study the processes that regulate the
                        abundance of ozone in the atmosphere. Data from the
                        GRACE and ICESat missions and from spaceborne radar show
                        unexpectedly rapid changes in the Earth's great ice
                        sheets, while the Jason-3, OSTM/Jason-2 and Jason-1
                        missions have recorded a sea level rise of an average of
                        3 inches since 1992. NASA’s Earth Observing System’s
                        weather instruments have demonstrated significant
                        improvements in global forecast skill.

                        These capabilities -- nearly 30 years of satellite-based
                        solar and atmospheric temperature data -- helped the
                        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change come to the
                        conclusion in 2007 that "Most of the observed increase
                        in global average temperatures since the mid-20th
                        century is very likely due to the observed increase in
                        anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations." But
                        there's still a lot to learn about what the consequences
                        will be. How much warmer will it get? How will sea level
                        rise progress? NASA scientists and engineers will help
                        answer these and other critical questions in the future.

                    <p>
                        WILDFIRES CAN BURN millions of acres of land at
                        shockingly fast speeds, consuming everything in their
                        paths. These rolling flames travel up to 14 miles an
                        hour, which converts to about a four-minute-mile pace,
                        and can overtake the average human in minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though they are classified by the Environmental
                        Protection Agency as natural disasters, only 10 to 15
                        percent of wildfires occur on their own in nature. The
                        other 85 to 90 percent result from human causes,
                        including unattended camp and debris fires, discarded
                        cigarettes, and arson.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Naturally occurring wildfires can spark during dry
                        weather and droughts. In these conditions, normally
                        green vegetation can convert into bone-dry, flammable
                        fuel; strong winds spread fire quickly; and warm
                        temperatures encourage combustion. With these
                        ingredients, the only thing missing is a spark—in the
                        form of lightning, arson, a downed power line, or a
                        burning campfire or cigarette—to wreak havoc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wildfires occur when vegetated areas are set alight and
                        are particularly common during hot and dry periods. They
                        can occur in forests, grasslands, brush and deserts, and
                        with sufficient wind can rapidly spread. Unchecked, such
                        fires can cause devastation to forests and other areas
                        of vegetation. If fires approach or occur near towns or
                        cities it often prompts a precautionary evacuation, as
                        the direction fires may take are unpredictable.

                    <p>
                        A side-effect of wildfires that also threatens inhabited
                        areas is smoke. Fires create large quantities of smoke,
                        which can be spread far by wind and poses a respiratory
                        hazard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Satellites can be used to map the extent of a fire by
                        observing the smoke plumes and identifying burn scars.
                        Thermal infrared sensors can detect heat, thereby
                        pinpointing the exact locations of fires and data
                        acquired through the Charter may be passed on to
                        firefighters on the ground within a matter of hours,
                        providing helpful assistance for their efforts in
                        locating and combating fires.

                    <p>
                        Unchecked, such fires can cause devastation to forests
                        and other areas of vegetation. If fires approach or

                        The most common causes of fires are lightning strikes,
                        sparks during arid conditions, the eruption of
                        volcanoes, and man-made fires arising from deliberate

                    <h2>TSUNAMIS</h2>
                    <img src="../images/ND3.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        A tsunami is a series of ocean waves that sends surges
                        of water, sometimes reaching heights of over 100 feet
                        (30.5 meters), onto land. These walls of water can cause
                        widespread destruction when they crash ashore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These awe-inspiring waves are typically caused by large,
                        undersea earthquakes at tectonic plate boundaries. When
                        the ocean floor at a plate boundary rises or falls
                        suddenly, it displaces the water above it and launches
                        the rolling waves that will become a tsunami.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most tsunamis–about 80 percent–happen within the Pacific
                        Ocean’s “Ring of Fire,” a geologically active area where
                        tectonic shifts make volcanoes and earthquakes common.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tsunamis may also be caused by underwater landslides or
                        volcanic eruptions. They may even be launched, as they
                        frequently were in Earth’s ancient past, by the impact
                        of a large meteorite plunging into an ocean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A tsunami’s trough, the low point beneath the wave’s
                        crest, often reaches shore first. When it does, it
                        produces a vacuum effect that sucks coastal water
                        seaward and exposes harbor and sea floors. This
                        retreating of sea water is an important warning sign of
                        a tsunami, because the wave’s crest and its enormous
                        volume of water typically hit shore five minutes or so
                        later. Recognizing this phenomenon can save lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A tsunami is usually composed of a series of waves,
                        called a wave train, so its destructive force may be
                        compounded as successive waves reach shore. People
                        experiencing a tsunami should remember that the danger
                        may not have passed with the first wave and should await
                        official word that it is safe to return to vulnerable
                        locations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best defense against any tsunami is early warning
                        that allows people to seek higher ground. The Pacific
                        Tsunami Warning System, a coalition of 26 nations
                        headquartered in Hawaii, maintains a web of seismic
                        equipment and water level gauges to identify tsunamis at
                        sea. Similar systems are proposed to protect coastal
                        areas worldwide.

                    <h2>Tornadoes</h2>
                    <img src="../images/ND4.png" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        Tornadoes are vertical funnels of rapidly spinning air.
                        Their winds may top 250 miles an hour and can clear a
                        pathway a mile wide and 50 miles long. Also known as
                        twisters, tornadoes are born in thunderstorms and are
                        often accompanied by hail. Giant, persistent
                        thunderstorms called supercells spawn the most
                        destructive tornadoes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that
                        extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. It's often
                        portended by a dark, greenish sky. Black storm clouds
                        gather. Baseball-size hail may fall. A funnel suddenly
                        appears, as though descending from a cloud. The funnel
                        hits the ground and roars forward with a sound like that
                        of a freight train approaching. The tornado tears up
                        everything in its path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most violent tornadoes come from supercells, large
                        thunderstorms that have winds already in rotation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tornadoes can occur at any time of year, but they are
                        more common during a distinct season that begins in
                        early spring for the states along the Gulf of Mexico.
                        The season follows the jet stream—as it swings farther
                        north, so does tornado activity. May generally has more
                        tornadoes than any other month, but April's twisters are
                        sometimes more violent. Farther north, tornadoes tend to
                        be more common later in summer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the rotating updraft, called a mesocycle, draws in
                        more warm air from the moving thunderstorm, its rotation
                        speed increases. Cool air fed by the jet stream, a
                        strong band of wind in the atmosphere, provides even
                        more energy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Water droplets from the mesocyclone's moist air form a
                        funnel cloud. The funnel continues to grow and
                        eventually it descends from the cloud. When it touches
                        the ground, it becomes a tornado.

                    <h2>Earthquake</h2>
                    <p>
                        An earthquake is an intense shaking of Earth’s surface.
                        The shaking is caused by movements in Earth’s outermost
                        layer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the Earth looks like a pretty solid place from
                        the surface, it’s actually extremely active just below
                        the surface. The Earth is made of four basic layers: a
                        solid crust, a hot, nearly solid mantle, a liquid outer
                        core and a solid inner core.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This non-stop movement causes stress on Earth’s crust.
                        When the stresses get too large, it leads to cracks
                        called faults. When tectonic plates move, it also causes
                        movements at the faults. An earthquake is the sudden
                        movement of Earth’s crust at a fault line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The energy from an earthquake travels through Earth in
                        vibrations called seismic waves. Scientists can measure
                        these seismic waves on instruments called seismometer. A
                        seismometer detects seismic waves below the instrument
                        and records them as a series of zig-zags. Earthquake is
                        a name for seismic activity on Earth, but Earth isn’t
                        the only place with seismic activity. Scientists have
                        measured quakes on the Earth’s moon, and see evidence
                        for seismic activity on Mars, Venus and several moons of
                        Jupiter, too!

                    <p>
                        NASA’s InSight mission will carry a seismometer to Mars
                        to study seismic activity there, known as marsquakes. On
                        Earth, we know that different materials vibrate in
                        different ways. By studying the vibrations from
                        marsquakes, scientists hope to figure out what materials
                        are found on the inside of Mars.

                        Glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising, cloud
                        forests are dying, and wildlife is scrambling to keep
                        pace. It has become clear that humans have caused most
                        of the past century's warming by releasing heat-trapping
                        gases as we power our modern lives. Called greenhouse
                        gases, their levels are higher now than at any time in
                        the last 800,000 years.

                        We often call the result global warming, but it is
                        causing a set of changes to the Earth's climate, or
                        long-term weather patterns, that varies from place to
                        place. While many people think of global warming and
                        climate change as synonyms, scientists use “climate
                        change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting
                        our planet’s weather and climate systems—in part because
                        some areas actually get cooler in the short term.

                    <p>
                        Climate change encompasses not only rising average
                        temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting
                        wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a
                        range of other impacts. All of those changes are
                        emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping
                        greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, changing the rhythms
                        of climate that all living things have come to rely on.

                        What will we do—what can we do—to slow this human-caused
                        warming? How will we cope with the changes we've already
                        set into motion? While we struggle to figure it all out,
                        the fate of the Earth as we know it—coasts, forests,
                        farms, and snow-capped mountains—hangs in the balance.

                    <h2>Understanding the greenhouse effect</h2>
                    <img src="../images/global warming 3.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        The "greenhouse effect" is the warming that happens
                        when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat.
                        These gases let in light but keep heat from escaping,
                        like the glass walls of a greenhouse, hence the name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sunlight shines onto the Earth's surface, where the
                        energy is absorbed and then radiate back into the
                        atmosphere as heat. In the atmosphere, greenhouse gas
                        molecules trap some of the heat, and the rest escapes
                        into space. The more greenhouse gases concentrate in the
                        atmosphere, the more heat gets locked up in the
                        molecules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Scientists have known about the greenhouse effect since
                        1824, when Joseph Fourier calculated that the Earth
                        would be much colder if it had no atmosphere. This
                        natural greenhouse effect is what keeps the Earth's
                        climate livable. Without it, the Earth's surface would
                        be an average of about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees
                        Celsius) cooler.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1895, the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius discovered
                        that humans could enhance the greenhouse effect
                        by making carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. He kicked
                        off 100 years of climate research that has given us a
                        sophisticated understanding of global warming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Levels of greenhouse gases have gone up and down over
                        the Earth's history, but they had been fairly constant
                        for the past few thousand years. Global average
                        temperatures had also stayed fairly constant over that
                        time—until the past 150 years. Through the burning of
                        fossil fuels and other activities that have emitted
                        large amounts of greenhouse gases, particularly over the
                        past few decades, humans are now enhancing the
                        greenhouse effect and warming Earth significantly, and
                        in ways that promise many effects, scientists warn.

                    <br />
                    <h2>Aren't temperature changes natural?</h2>
                    <img src="../images/global warming 4.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p>
                        Human activity isn't the only factor that affects
                        Earth's climate. Volcanic eruptions and variations in
                        solar radiation from sunspots, solar wind, and the
                        Earth's position relative to the sun also play a role.
                        So do large-scale weather patterns such as El Niño.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But climate models that scientists use to monitor
                        Earth’s temperatures take those factors into account.
                        Changes in solar radiation levels as well as minute
                        particles suspended in the atmosphere from volcanic
                        eruptions, for example, have contributed only about two
                        percent to the recent warming effect. The balance comes
                        from greenhouse gases and other human-caused factors,
                        such as land use change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The short timescale of this recent warming is singular
                        as well. Volcanic eruptions, for example, emit particles
                        that temporarily cool the Earth's surface. But their
                        effect lasts just a few years. Events like El Niño also
                        work on fairly short and predictable cycles. On the
                        other hand, the types of global temperature fluctuations
                        that have contributed to ice ages occur on a cycle of
                        hundreds of thousands of years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For thousands of years now, emissions of greenhouse
                        gases to the atmosphere have been balanced out by
                        greenhouse gases that are naturally absorbed. As a
                        result, greenhouse gas concentrations and temperatures
                        have been fairly stable, which has allowed human
                        civilization to flourish within a consistent climate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, humans have increased the amount of carbon dioxide
                        in the atmosphere by more than a third since the
                        Industrial Revolution. Changes that have historically
                        taken thousands of years are now happening over the
                        course of decades.

                    <br />
                    <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The rapid rise in greenhouse gases is a problem because
                        it’s changing the climate faster than some living things
                        can adapt to. Also, a new and more unpredictable climate
                        poses unique challenges to all life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Historically, Earth's climate has regularly shifted
                        between temperatures like those we see today and
                        temperatures cold enough to cover much of North America
                        and Europe with ice. The difference between average
                        global temperatures today and during those ice ages is
                        only about 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius), and
                        the swings have tended to happen slowly, over hundreds
                        of thousands of years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But with concentrations of greenhouse gases rising,
                        Earth's remaining ice sheets such as Greenland and
                        Antarctica are starting to melt too. That extra water
                        could raise sea levels significantly, and quickly. By
                        2050, sea levels are predicted to rise between one and
                        2.3 feet as glaciers melt.

                    <p>
                        As the mercury rises, the climate can change in
                        unexpected ways. In addition to sea levels
                        rising, weather can become more extreme. This means more
                        intense major storms, more rain followed by longer and
                        drier droughts—a challenge for growing crops—changes in
                        the ranges in which plants and animals can live, and
                        loss of water supplies that have historically come from
                        glaciers.
